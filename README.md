_Comparison of proportions:_ You want to gather data to determine which of two students is a better basketball shooter. One of them shoots with 30% accuracy and the other is a 40% shooter. Each student takes 20 shots and you then compare their shooting percentages. What is the probability that the better shooter makes more shots in this small experiment?

### 5. (based on ROS 4.4) 5 points
_Designing an experiment:_ Now, you want to gather data to determine which of the two students is a better basketball shooter. Assume student one has 30% accuracy and student 2 has 40% accuracy. The goal is to choose N, the number of shots taken, so that you have a good chance to identify the better shooter. Your collaborator, the head basketball coach, says they have time for each student to take up to 200 shots. Create a graphic that shows the probability that better shooter makes more shots as a function of N (Consider starting with 20 shots and going to 40, 60,80,100,120,140,160,180,200).
